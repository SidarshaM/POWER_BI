SALE ANALYSIS REPORT 

The aim of the project is to create an interactive report that explores and analyzes sales data through data visualization and analysis. The objective of this project is to create an intuitive interface that allows users to gain insights into sales trends, sales performance, product performance, and location analysis. The above overview shows that there are five main products, which are: Amarilla, Carretera, Montana, Paseo, Velo, and VTT it sells the products to five main segments: Change Partners, Enterprise, Government, Mid-Market and Small business and its products are in demand in five major countries (Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, United States of Aerica).
The main focus is on sales from 2013 and 2014. The sales in 2014 (1.13M) were superior to those in 2013 (264.67k). The sale in September in 2013 was lower than in other months. The highest sales in 2014 were in July and April
The enterprise segment has been unsuccessful in making a profit four times, while the government segment has the highest profit rate.
Both years, the overall performance of the government segment was remarkable, while the performance of enterprises and small businesses was moderate. Paseo was the highest sold product and had a total profit of about 4418885, while Montana's total profit was only 1837158. In these years, it was Canada that had the highest sales, while Mexico had only 18995477 sales.
